            <p className="text-[#4A5568] text-lg">
              We're making it <span className="font-bold">as easy to order from local businesses</span> as it is from Amazon. People want to support 
              their neighborhood stores, but <span className="font-bold">big retailers have made convenience the deciding factor</span>. We're changing that.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#4A5568] text-lg mt-4">
              Even Amazon and larger retailers <span className="font-bold">can't beat our local same-day delivery</span> when it comes to neighborhood shopping.

            <p className="text-[#4A5568] text-lg mb-4">
              We're starting with products that people <span className="font-bold">prefer to buy locally but can't easily get delivered</span>â€”coffee beans, 
              baby supplies, pet supplies, and craft supplies. By connecting these local businesses with their customers, 
              we <span className="font-bold">keep money in the community</span> and help neighborhood shops thrive.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#2D3748] mt-5 mb-2">How it works:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-[#4A5568] text-lg space-y-2">
              <li>List items from local stores in one convenient marketplace</li>
              <li>Ensure inventory is available</li>
              <li>Handle same-day or next-day delivery to your door</li>

              We're <span className="font-bold">software engineers who live in Astoria</span> (and one of us was born right here in NYC). 
              We built LocalMart because we believe <span className="font-bold">communities are stronger when local shops succeed</span>.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#4A5568] text-lg mt-4">
              We're friends who are passionate about our neighborhood and <span className="font-bold">have been organizing the Astoria Tech Meetup since 2019</span>. 
              Our team is small but mighty, and we're dedicated to making it easier for everyone to shop local.
